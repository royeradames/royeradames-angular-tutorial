## The `<label>` Element
> The **for attribute of the `<label> `tag should be equal to the id attribute** of the `<input>` element to bind them together.
- The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.
- The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
