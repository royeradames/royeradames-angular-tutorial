Because Angular is a single page application. Angular makes a Javascript Object representation with the form with values and meta data. The meta data has things has if the form has been touch, or if a input has been correctly filed. From there you can send the form data to a server though Angular HTTP request. Angular has 2 method of doing form

- `Template-driven (TD)` Angular infers the form object from the DOM

- `Reactive Approach` Form is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM

Reactive approach is used for production. TD is was the only option for Angular v1.
